    title: Belfast
    description: Start in the Titanic City, a lively hub that turns its industrial heritage into a cool cultural playground. A city of characters, its quarters each show a different side to the city; the red-brick and cobbles of the Cathedral Quarter, the industrial revival of the Titanic Quarter, and the buzzing drinks and dining scene of the trendy Linen Quarter – to name a few. Each shows a side to the city that is set to enchant visitors, making a Belfast stop-off good craic.

    title: Carrickfergus Castle
    description: You may barely have left Belfast, but your first stop offers a glimpse at Northern Ireland’s ancient history. Carrickfergus Castle is one of the best preserved medieval castles in Ireland, a Norman fortress with a turbulent 800-year history. It’s also wonderfully picturesque, guarding the Belfast lough and pretty harbour that lies next to its imposing walls.

    title: The Gobbins
    description: As you reach the Irish Sea, it’s time to embrace the wilds of the coastline. The Gobbins Cliff Path is a quite remarkable set of suspended walkways and bridges, hugging the weathered cliffs battered by the turbulent sea. Follow the trails as they wind down the cliff edge, putting you dramatically close to the crashing waves. Catch glimpses of smugglers’ caves and isolated coves, before hitting the road and chasing the coastline.

    title: The Coast Road
    description: The Causeway Coastal Route is defined by this coast road. The stretch from Larne to Ballycastle particularly, is some of the most breathtaking driving in the UK. So, soak up the twists and turns, the stupendous sea views, and hit the road.

    title: Glenarm Castle & Gardens
    description: If you’re in need of a quick stop, indulge in a cream tea at Glenarm Castle. This idyllic estate has some beautiful walled gardens to wander, before a trip to the tea rooms. The estate also has an organic farm which sells its wares in the shop - perfect for some on-the-road snacking.
  - id: torrHead
    title: Torr Head
    description: Keep chasing the coast road after Cushenden and alight at Torr Head. The road continues to prove itself a breathtaking drive, with a stop at the headland allowing for a quick leg-stretch complemented by ravishing views.

    title: Ballycastle & Rathlin Island
    description: If you fancy a blast of sea air and wildlife, park up in Ballycastle and take the ferry across to Rathlin Island. This tiny outcrop is home to just 140 people, where legends of Robert the Bruce vie for attention alongside the puffins and seals that inhabit the island’s cliffs. Back on the mainland, grab yourself a chipper from Morton’s, frying fish that comes in fresh from the harbour.
  - id: theDarkHedges
    title: The Dark Hedges
    description: A short detour from the coast road, The Dark Hedges have become somewhat of a Northern Irish icon. Famous for appearing in Game of Thrones, this unique tunnel of twisting beech trees is a moody and evocative scene.

    title: Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge
    description:
      - More and more beauty along the coast awaits. Grab your ticket for your chance to cross the famous rope bridge which connects the small island to the mainland. Following in the footsteps of the salmon fisherman, the rickety bridge takes a bit of stomach to cross, but the views are a just reward for your daring.
      - If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, dive deep into the bracing waters of Larrybane Bay and swim across to the island. Passing under the rope-bridge, this 1km swim is as visually compelling as it is challenging, with grass-topped cliffs, coastal caves and rocky outcrops to see on your crawl to the other side. For experienced swimmers only!
  - id: ballintoyHarbour
    title: Ballintoy Harbour
    description: A little further up the coast, Ballintoy harbour is a rather dreamy throwback to a bygone age. Which is why, of course, it’s been used as a filming location for Game of Thrones. There’s an idyllic, even nostalgic quality to it; as if it has been forgotten for centuries. It may sound a little hyperbolic, but it really is one of the joys of this stretch of coastline, that everything is a little untamed and untouched.
  - id: giantSCauseway
    title: Giant’s Causeway
    description: Northern Ireland’s most famous landmark looms on the horizon. The Giant’s Causeway is an icon of this coastline, a peculiar scene packed with all the drama of crashing waves and hexagonal perplexity. It is rather mad to think nature formed such mesmerizingly uniform structures, and in this lies the cause of the myths and legends that abound here. Caught at sunset, the Causeway makes for a truly spectacular experience.
  - id: bushmillsDistillery
    title: Bushmills Distillery
    description: For a taste of proper Irish whiskey, stop off at the Old Bushmills Distillery, the island’s oldest working distillery and the oldest licensed distillery in the world. Originally licensed in 1608, there’s over 400 years of heritage in each dram, so hop on a tour and savour one of Northern Ireland’s most coveted exports.
  - id: dunluceCastle
    title: Dunluce Castle
    description: Further along the coast, the romantic ruins of Dunluce Castle perch precariously on a headland; so precarious in fact, part of the kitchen fell into the sea in 1639. It's one of those sights that stops you in your tracks a little. Evocative, beautiful even, and for keen history buffs packed with centuries of conflict, a microcosmic history of the wider politics of Northern Ireland. A worthy diversion from the thrill of the coast road.

    title: Tour the political street-art of Derry/Londonderry
    description: You made it! And now you’re in Derry/Londonderry, a place brimming with quite unique adventures. For a The series of murals decorating the buildings in the Bogside area of Derry shine a reflective light on the events of the Troubles; a moving testament to the sombre history of Ireland’s past. Appropriating the stark, journalistic imagery of the times, the murals depict the Battle of Bogside, Bloody Sunday, the 1981 hunger strike, and many others.
