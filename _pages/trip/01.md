    title: Barmouth
    description: Start at the pretty seaside town of Barmouth. As Snowdonia’s premiere seaside resort, you’ll find long, sandy beaches and typical seaside fayre at every turn. Georgian cottages pile down a rocky crag to an idyllic harbour, the perfect setting for a chippy tea before embarking on your adventure.

    title: Coed y Brenin MTB
    description: Add a touch of daring to your Snowdonia road trip. Park up and tackle the vertiginous landscape on two wheels, with a mountain bike trek of the forested fells and gorgeous trails. The Coed y Brenin forest park is a perfect environment for testing your off-road push-bike skills, for an adventurous back-to-nature experience for all skill levels.

    title: Castles & Canyoning in Harlech
    description:
      - Hilly Harlech is a pleasant and notably upmarket town, with a long sandy beach at its flank. Filled with tea shops and antiques, live like a lord and lady as you admire the striking hilltop castle that peers over the town. When you’re done stuffing your face with Welsh cakes and sarnies, dispel of the niceties and get in on the canyoning action at Adrenaline Addicts.
      - The inland version of coasteering (also offered here) will see you spilling into wild waters, struggling upstream and abseiling waterfalls. If all that sounds a little too daring, you could just hire a kayak. Either is good, both are guaranteed to immerse you in the wild Snowdonia landscape.

    title: Portmeirion
    description: Heading further north along the coast, you’ll soon stumble upon one of Wales’ famous oddities. Portmeirion is equal parts beautiful and totally mad, a flamboyant, colourful, teleported Italianate town that is totally out of place yet a mainstay of the Snowdonia coastline. Certain street scenes will lull you into believing you’ve found yourself in an Italian village; others will convince you you’ve stumbled onto the set of Alice in Wonderland. Pinch yourself occasionally and enjoy the enchanting whimsy of the place.

    title: Cavern adventures
    description: Suspended in the vast caverns of an old abandoned slate mine, Go Below is a playground of underground adventure. From zip-lining to boating - that’s right, boating in a subterranean lake - Go Below makes for a spine-chilling experience. If all that sounds like too much hard work, nearby Bounce Below have a network of underground trampolines, which looks about the most fun you could ever wish to have in a cave.

    title: Llŷn Peninsula
    description: The Llŷn Peninsula is a wild outcrop, little-developed and notably untamed. With a mix of Iron Age hill forts, abundant wildlife and quaint fishing villages like Aberdaron and Abersoch, the peninsula is ripe for a day of exploration.

  - id: caernarfon
    title: Caernarfon
    description: Caernarfon is a bastion of Welsh culture. Wander the medieval streets and you’ll overwhelmingly hear the gentle tones of the Welsh language flowing out of ice cream shops and cafes. Tucked between the Menai Strait and the Snowdonia peaks, it’s a pretty stop-off, with an idyllic waterfront ideal for schmoozing away an afternoon. Its centrepiece is undoubtedly the magnificent 13th century castle, which dominates the town in all its imposing glory.

    title: Pen-Y-Pass & Capel Curig
    description:
      - The coast road may take you to Conwy directly, but you’d miss the tarmarced drama of the Pen y Pass and remote feel of Capel Curig. So, head the long way around and drive deep into Snowdonia. As soon as you leave Caernarfon, the road climbs steeply past the peaks of Snowdon and Glyder Fawr, sandwiching the twisting road between two mountain walls. The Pen y Pass is also the gateway to the walking trails up Snowdon, with a cafe and car park worth stopping for just to admire the gorgeous views.
      - As the road wiggles through its descent, you’ll arrive at the old miners town of Capel Curig, now the centre for Sonwdonia thrill seekers and overnighters. Usually a-buzz with cafes, bars and more, it’s a pretty riverside stop deep in the heart of the national park.
  - id: conwy
    title: Conwy
    description: Head back to the coast for our final stop. Conwy is a magnificent walled town, another Edward I project from the 13th century. Keeping guard over its eponymous river mouth, the fortress town makes for another pleasant stop. Follow the vast curtain walls for cracking views over the river and mountains, before exploring the castle and ancient lanes filled with craft shops and cafes.
