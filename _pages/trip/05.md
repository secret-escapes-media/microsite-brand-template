stops:
  - id: foragingInStudlandBay
    title: Foraging in Studland Bay
    description: A unique first stop on your Dorset road trip, get closer to nature and learn how to live off the land as you gather your ingredients from the sea and shoreline of Studland Bay. The Fore Adventure sea school has day-long crash courses in the art of foraging, teaching you how to find everything from crabs and cockles to edible plants and seaweeds. You travel by kayak to the creeks and islands around the bay, before bringing all your freshly-foraged ingredients together in the evening for a feast on the beach.
  - id: swanageBeyond
    title: Swanage & Beyond
    description: After your foraging adventure, head for the town of Swanage. You’ll find typical Victorian seaside charm, a grand fish and chip shop and, most importantly, a steam railway! The track runs all the way to Corfe, should you wish to skip the drive. There are a few stops eastward along the coastline that are worth a detour. Head toward Worth Matravers, stopping at Spyway Dinosaur Footprints. The name gives it away, but this will be your first taste of the Jurassic Coast’s, erm, Jurassic heritage. Once you’ve compared shoe size with our prehistoric friends, aim for St Aldhelm's Head. At this craggy headland, you’ll find a tiny stone chapel overlooking the coast. Remarkably, it dates back to the 12th century and is every-bit intact. It really is a jewel of this coastline, perfectly framed in the walking trails that wander east and west from this point.

    title: Corfe Castle
    description: Head inland to the idyllic village of Corfe Castle. The shattered ruins of the town’s namesake are an evocative icon on the landscape, a tumbling mess of vast walls and crumbling towers. Destroyed by Cromwellian forces during the Civil War, it now sits handsomely on a hill overlooking the chocolate-box village below. Grab a cream tea and some road snacks before heading back to the coast and the scenic road that chases it.

  - id: kimmeridgeBay
    title: Kimmeridge Bay
    description: This shallow bay is a perfect spot for that treasured seaside pastime - rockpooling. The road down to the bay has a toll booth, aiding the conservation of the area. The more limited numbers of cars means that Kimmeridge has an unspoilt quality to it; its sweeping architecture, chunky cliffs and rocky shore are a pretty spectacular sight. Dart across the rockpools and hunt for crabs, or, if the weather permits, try your hand at snorkelling. The bay is renowned for being one of the coast’s best snorkelling spots, overlooked by the looming folly of Clavell Tower.

    title: Lulworth Cove & Man O’War
    description:
      - As you leave Kimmeridge Bay on the winding coastal road, don’t miss the left turn on Grange Hill. You’ll spot a peculiar MOD sign; the road is the most direct for Lulworth, the road is also stunning, and the road winds through the MOD firing range. It will take you past scenic viewpoints and the rather peculiar village of Tyneham, abandoned since the war and now occasionally used by the army for training - it is open to the public when the soldiers aren’t invading the hapless place.
      - If you’ve avoided the artillery shells and your car is still intact, Lulworth Cove awaits. One of Dorset’s most famed beauty spots, the cove - and the iconic Durdle Door - is an unmissable stop when exploring the Jurassic Coast. The hamlet itself is pretty enough, but the cove is simply stunning. The cliff top trail that heads west is a popular pilgrimage, where you’ll pass Man O’War cove - another idyllic crescent-shaped beach - and finally arrive at Durdle Door. Make sure you’ve packed a picnic, as this stop-off is one of the highlights of the coastline and you’ll want every excuse to stay longer and soak it all in.

    title: Weymouth
    description: Time to head back to something a little livelier, with a stop at the pretty town of Weymouth. Its long beach has all the candy-striped amenities you’d expect, for your rock, deckchair, ice cream and arcade et al. It’s popular year-round, with a laid-back atmosphere. However, the town really sings around the corner, at the historic harbour. Lined by heritage buildings in a burst of colours, obscured by a sea of masts, it’s a lovely place to sink a pint as the sun sets, returning for some crabbing the next day. With a clutch of good restaurants and historic pubs, Weymouth is an awfully pleasant seaside stopover.

  - id: abbotsburySwannery
    title: Abbotsbury Swannery
    description: Founded by monks over 600 years ago, Abbotsbury Swannery is one of the more eccentric sights on the Dorset coast. Some 600 swans call the place a home, making for a truly spectacular display on any visit. Just be careful; a swan can break a man’s arm.
  - id: westBay
    title: West Bay
    description: From the delightful swannery, the road meanders along the coast to another of those famed Dorset beauty spots - West Bay. The beach is gorgeous, with a small harbour facilitating your chipper and ice cream needs. Take a rowboat up the river Brit, or climb to the top of the dauntingly high cliffs. The geological lines of the cliff face coupled with their awesome scale makes the bay wonderfully photogenic, a perfect backdrop for your beach getaway.
  - id: charmouthFossilHunting
    title: Charmouth Fossil Hunting
    description: No trip to the Jurassic Coast would be complete without a spot of fossil hunting. Charmouth Beach contends with Lyme Regis as one of the best places to score your prehistoric souvenir. Patience is key; pay particular attention to the rocky bed of the beach, turning stones and pebbles as you see fit, and you may just walk away with your very own ammonite.
  - id: lymeRegis
    title: Lyme Regis
    description: The final stop on this Dorset road trip, Lyme Regis is a charming little fishing town. It’s cluster of medieval thatched cottages, Regency grandeur and Edwardian sensibility is a picturesque mishmash, centred around a crescent harbour and pretty promenade. Oh, and fossil fever is rife here too. It’s historic, pumped with charm, and irresistibly laidback - sink into trad pubs and rustic restaurants, peacock down the promenade, and bookmark your Dorset trip in style.
