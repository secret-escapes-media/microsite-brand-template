    title: Dungeness
    description: It’s a strange if not disorientating start for a road trip. Dungeness, in all its shingled glory, offers a landscape that is stark and strange. The long shingle expanse is punctuated by a tall, dark lighthouse, backdropped by a power station whose pylons stretch into the distance. Small fisherman’s huts and cottages sparsely populate the peninsula, increasing the sense of total isolation. Throw in oddities like a miniature steam railway, an exquisite seafood shack all on its own, and a clutch of art installations throughout, and you have one of the most extraordinary coastal destinations in the country. If you start feeling a little twitchy, best to breeze past the far more pleasant stretch known as Camber Sands before arriving at your first stop.

    title: Rye
    description: It’s rare to find a town so picturesque – Rye is an old-world jewel, a medieval, cobbled, creaky town that is perhaps one of the most beautiful on the south coast. Tumbling Tudor fronts line the high street, casting shade on the gulleys and snickets that wind through the back streets. Explore them and you’ll find hidden-away pubs, delightful tea rooms, crafty shops, and the catch-of-the-day served up in cosy restaurants. Rye is, simply put, beautiful. But don’t linger too long, this part of Sussex abounds with jaw-dropping towns and villages.

    title: Winchelsea
    description: A case in point; barely have you left Rye and Winchelsea looms into view. After a hair-raising hairpin, look out for the medieval gate that appears out of seemingly nowhere. It is, of course, the entrance to this once prosperous town. A victim to modernity and erosion, Winchelsea was once an incredibly important port town. Since the 15th century however, it has steadily declined, which offers a strange grandeur to the place that seems at odds with its diminutive size. Laid out in a unique grid pattern, walk its few streets and embrace the village idyll, a perfect Sussex hamlet that seems lifted from the set of a twee and gentle rom-com.

    title: Hastings
    description: A once fashionable Victorian resort, Hastings has reinvented itself as a wonderful mix of classic seaside charms and stylish hub of creatives, with a smattering of indie businesses offering fine wares to savvy visitors. Head for the pier with fish and chips in hand, brave the cliffside funicular and walk the pretty streets of the Old Town, finding bargains in the town’s many antique and bric-a-brac stores. Discover design-forward boutiques, record shops, craft bars and more – it’s a town of two very different experiences that somehow seamlessly fit together.

    title: Beachy Head & Birling Gap
    description: An icon of the Sussex Coast, the chalky white cliffs are one of those picture-postcard perfect scenes. Take Beachy Head road for an elevated straight, a horizon that disappears off the tall cliffs you’re speeding toward. The first stop is Beachy Head, the tallest cliff around, and a short walk to its rather daunting edge offers stomach-turning views - remember, there’s no railings, just one menacing drop. Don’t miss top-down views of the lighthouse as you clamber to the head. Further down the road, the twists and turns snake around the cliffs, where another stop at Birling Gap (fitted out with a visitors centre where you can grab a coffee) provides views of Beachy head to the left, and the Seven Sisters to the right.

    title: Brighton
    description: Bohemian Brighton, a hedonist mecca, coastal cultural capital, artsy and chic. Its like no other seaside town; flamboyant and proud, it’s a buzzing place where fun is a guarantee. Filled with those creative types, explore the Lanes for indie shopping, where boutique and handmade reigns supreme. Throw in some of the coolest cafe and bar hangouts anywhere in the south, and you’ve got one dazzling destination.

  - id: arundel
    title: Arundel
    description: Arundel is surely the most fairytale of fairytale castles in England. It dwarfs the idyllic village to its side, towering above the South Downs hills in all its pomp and splendour. Its Norman roots are overshadowed by the whimsical Gothic remodel in the 19th century, which its romantic appearance owes alot to. In the village, most places cater to the throngs of eager visitors. That means there’s no shortage of cream teas, lunches, antiques and trinkets to indulge in. In fact, stock up now, because you’d be a fool to miss the gorgeous walking opportunities and incredible roads that wind through the South Downs.
