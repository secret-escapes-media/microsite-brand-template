stops:
  - id: warkworth
    title: Warkworth
    description: Start at the pretty village of Warkworth, nestled in the southern reaches of the Northumberland Heritage Coast. Surrounded by the river Coquet, the cross-shaped keep of the castle stands watch over the high street, a reminder of the 600 years of history waiting to be explored.  The highlight has to be the gentle boat trip to the castle’s hermitage, a small private chapel cut into the sandstone rock face about a mile down river; one of Northumberland’s most treasured hidden gems. Leave the village to the north, looking out for the original medieval bridge and gatehouse, before chasing the coast road.
  - id: discoverTheSmokehouseOfCraster
    title: Discover the smokehouse of Craster
    description: This secluded fishing village is every bit picture-perfect. Cottages and fishing boats are haphazardly slung along the shoreline, all facing the small harbour and its thick walls. Yet this most unassuming place is responsible for one of Britain’s most cherished maritime delicacies - kippers. Craster Kippers, which grace the breakfast table of the Queen often enough, are still smoked here in the traditional way - a centuries-old tradition perfect for that road-trip pick-me-up.

    title: Dunstanburgh Castle
    description: Before leaving Craster, don’t miss the beautiful walk along the coast - past grazing sheep - to Duntanburgh Castle. This moody 14th-century ruin is a worthy trek, and though the antithesis to this guide, the non-vehicular access is a rare and special thing. Photo-op finished with, walk the mile-and-a-bit back to Craster for your next destination.

  - id: seahousesToTheFarneIslands
    title: Seahouses to the Farne Islands
    description: Further north still, and you’ll reach the tourist hub of Seahouses. It has a pretty harbourfront, with plenty of pubs and chippies to choose from should you need a recharge. The highlight has to be the boat trips out to the Farne Islands, however. During breeding season, the Farne Islands are home to a dazzling array of seabirds (notably including irresistably cute puffins) plus some 6,000 grey seals basking on the rocks. Inner Farne is also the place where St Cuthbert died and an old chapel commemorates his time here.
  - id: bamburghCastle
    title: Bamburgh Castle
    description: It wouldn’t be unfair to say Bamburgh is one of the finest castles in Britain. Its sheer scale, perched on a cliff that overlooks the long, sandy dunes, makes for a striking impression. It’s also a size totally at odds with the clutch of village buildings that surround the manicured green just outside the castle walls. What you see today is a development of the original Norman keep, which replaced an earlier Saxon fortification. Its past is a who’s who of British history, something the castle interior unravels within medieval halls and watched by shining suits of armour. Don’t miss the sandy beach for wide-angle shots of the castle, plus the most perfect picnic bench in the country, apparently.
  - id: journeyToTheHolyIslandOfLindisfarneNorthumberland
    title: Journey to the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, Northumberland
    description: When the tide goes out, drive across the sand of the Holy Island Causeway to the magical island of Lindisfarne. With a recorded history dating back to the 6th century AD, walk in the footsteps of monks, vikings invaders and Norman conquerors as you visit the incredible array of historical landmarks and ruins. Due to the isolated, intertidal nature of the island, Lindisfarne is an ideal escape for those in need of a digital detox, whilst being equally unmissable as a day trip from Northumberland - just remember to check the tides before you visit!

  - id: berwickUponTweed
    title: Berwick-upon-Tweed
    description: Soak up as much of that coastline as you can, before entering the fortified town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. Entering via the sandstone Old Bridge, park up in England’s northernmost town; the peculiar accent is a giveaway, a strange Scottish twang clearly punctuating that northeast lilt. It’s also a clue to the town’s history; it is the most fought-over settlement in Europe, its walls alluding to the to-and-fro between the English and Scots. Now that that is all settled, you’ll find a bustling market town with cafes and antique shops, restaurants and pubs vying for attention. Harbour boat trips and wall walks add to the experience. As a final tip, head to family-run Forte’s, a stalwart throwback little-changed since the 60s. Order a coke float and indulge in the little Italian heritage of the area.
  - id: diveTheCathedralInStAbbs
    title: Dive The Cathedral in St Abbs
    description: Following the A1 north, you’ll be in Scotland in the blink of an eye. Head for the quaint port town oof St Abbs and discover a remarkable underwater landscape carved out by the wild North Sea. The clear waters around the town form part of a marine reserve that offers some of the best cold-water diving anywhere in Europe. From grey seals to the unfortunately ugly wolffish, discover a surprising aquatic world.
  - id: dunbar
    title: Dunbar
    description: After an adventorous dive off the Scottish coast, head  further north still and take a breath at Dunbar. Once one of the most important medieval fortresses in the country, Dunbar is now a peaceful fishing town with a pretty harbour and bustling high street. The remains of the old castle sit at the harbour mouth, a rock overlooking the town that once homed Mary Queen of Scots. Local John Muir, famed as the father of America’s national parks, is honoured by the eponymous country park that takes in the best of this pretty landscape.
  - id: trotTheSeacliffBeach
    title: Trot the Seacliff beach
    description: As your final outdoor stop, head or family-run Seacliff Stables, and explore this pretty beach on horseback. Trot along wild fens and sandy beach, with views of the impressive Bass Rock jutting out of the sea. As you head further up the cost, look out for the ruins of Tantallon Castle sitting on the headland. This area is little travelled by tourists, so enjoy this rugged landscape all for yourself.
  - id: edinburgh
    title: Edinburgh
    description: There’s perhaps no less enthralling an endpoint for a road trip than Edinburgh. The bustling heart of Scotland, the city is a hotbed of culture, from trendy art scenes to cool cafe and bar hangouts. Gorgeous architecture, boutique shopping, and centuries of history make Edinburgh an endlessly intriguing city, one that offers something new and fresh with each visit.
