    title: Glencoe
    description: What a place to start. You’ll likely have arrived on the A82, a road which in itself is jaw-droppingly beautiful, packed with drama as the mountains rise up on either side of the snaking tarmac. Look out for the pyramid of Buachaille Etive Mor in the east, a rocky and towering mountain that dominates the landscape. In winter, the Glencoe Mountain Resort has a host of snowy activities on offer, though summer can be equally as exciting with biking and tubing taking full advantage of the vertiginous landscape. Following the A82, you’re now in the Pass of Glencoe, where this road really begins to shine.

    title: Three Sisters
    description: Whilst here, stop at the magnificent Three Sisters. This triplet of soaring peaks is jaw-droppingly beautiful, and the perfect springboard for some the country’s finest hikes. The Aonach Eagach ridge to the north, a knife-edge pass over the mountain tops, is a favourite amongst serious climbers - should you have brought all your mountaineering kit.

    title: Fort William
    description: Head north on the A82, with a shimmering loch to one side and the silhouette of the towering Ben Nevis to the other. Soon you’ll reach Fort William. It’s the gateway to the surrounding landscapes, a place where adventure-seekers mingle and stock up on supplies. Whether you’re tough enough to tackle the slopes of Ben Nevis, or you’re ready to embark on inspired hikes through loch and mountain landscapes, this is the place to park up and explore the wilderness. If that sounds like too much hard work, you could instead pick up a bottle at the Ben Nevis Distillery, or hop on the Jacobite Steam Railway for a ride across the Glenfinnan Viaduct - more on that in a second, but its an opportunity not to be missed.

    title: Glenfinnan Viaduct
    description: Leave Fort William on the A830 – the road to the isles. It’s a truly spectacular road that winds through jaw-dropping highland scenes. There’s little traffic here and the twists and turns are a joy – the scenery changes from towering mountains to lochs and beaches, offering diverse backdrops to your drive. Nearly halfway to Mallaig, Glenfinnan waits at the mouth of the Loch Shiel. It extends into the horizon, framed by mountains that rise from the shores on either side. Soak up the view, then follow the small river Finnan to reach the Glenfinnan Viaduct. The viaduct is famous, featured in Harry Potter numerous times, making for a rather awesome scene – the walking trail from the train station is the best way to reach it.

    title: Skye & the Fairy Pools
    description: Take the car ferry from Mallaig to Armadale. You’re now on the Isle of Skye, and you’ll want to head north on the scenic coast road for Glen Brittle. Set off on a hike through the craggy scene in the shadow of the Black Cuillin Ridge. Cascading waterfalls and enchanting pools await, dotting the landscape with magnificently clear waters. These are the Fairy Pools, a fittingly enchanting name. If you’re feeling brave, take a dip!

    title: Tipsy Talisker
    description: Skye’s most famous export has to be the superlative Talisker single malt. You’ll find it across the island in pubs and bars, but nothing beats a tour of the distillery. Find out how this world-famous malt is made, on the shores of a shimmering loch. A perfect warmer after a long day, once you’re parked up and settling in for the night.

    title: Dunvegan Castle
    description: The road heading north snakes past lochs and mountains. Soon, you’ll spy a romantic fortress perched over the loch side. Clans, lochs and enchanting castles – Dunvegan paints a picture of picture-book Scotland. Home to the seat of the Chiefs of Clan MacLeod, you can expect the usual weapons and portraits, alongside curiosities like the pre-7th century Fairy Flag and Bonnie Prince Charlie’s waistcoat.
  - id: theQuiraing
    title: The Quiraing
    description: Another hiker’s dream, The Quiraing is another truly inspired landscape. Jutting peaks rise from the valley, an irresistible draw for intrepid adventurers. Breathtaking views are a given. You’re now at the northern edge of Skye, and there’s a wild, remote quality here that makes this place particularly special. Even just driving around here is special in itself, with single-track lanes navigating the twists and turns of the steep crags. Don’t tire yourself out too much though, another impeccable hike waits further south.
  - id: theStorr
    title: The Storr
    description: The Old Man of Storr is a jutting crag seen for miles around. It marks the top of Skye’s most famous walk. Head up the steep paths past monolithic, piercing stones, with panoramic views in plentiful supply. It’s a perfect finish for your loop around the island.

    description: If you’re still raring for more impeccable driving, then read on. You’re not too far away from one of the best driving roads in Britain. Head back to the mainland and head further north, along a gorgeous coast road that straddles lochs and mountains. Before turning onto the A890, head just a minute or two further to reach the evocative Eilean Donan Castle, before retracing your steps and carrying on further north. Soon you’ll reach the Bealach na Bà. As you approach the road to Applecross, a big sign warns of the perils you’ll face on this snaking mountain pass. It’s gradient climbs dramatically, with snake-like hairpins and turns that traverse a path of unforgettable panorama over Skye. After all that excitement, wind down at the peaceful seaside retreat of Applecross.
