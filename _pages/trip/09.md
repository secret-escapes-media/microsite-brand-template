  - id: orford
    title: Orford
    description: The coastline of Suffolk is filled with hidden away villages. Each feels like an adventure into some forgotten place; maybe it’s the fact that there is no real coast road connecting them, meaning you have to dart back and forth from the nearby A12. That, and their irresistible historic charm. Orford is as good a starting point for this as any; follow the long country lane dead-ended by the village. Composed of what feels like just three roads of pretty cottages, the centrepiece is the unique octagonal fortress that dwarfs the hamlet. Though tiny, Orford has some remarkably good places to eat. It’s pretty upmarket round these parts, don’t you know.

    title: Snape & the Alde
    description: Stop off at Snape Maltings, now a revived cultural centre with art, music, crafts and more. It’s worth having a potter around and picking up some local goods, before taking the pretty riverside walk in the direction of the coast. Not far in you’ll spy a little hut on the shoreline, where during the right months you can hire a canoe or paddle board. It’s cheap and cheerful, gliding along this calm part of the river - the standout though is catching a glimpse of the basking seals that dot the lengthy sandbanks. It’s a perfect habitat for them, and you can get pretty close without disturbing the seals. After that bit of fun, head to the coast again for a seaside frolic in Aldeburgh.

    title: Aldeburgh Chips
    description: Aldeburgh is an attractive seaside town, with a brightly-painted mismatch of homes lining the beachfront. It’s also rumoured to have the best chippy in the country. Since 1967, the stalwart chippy Aldeburgh Fish & Chips has been frying the day’s fresh catch, becoming so popular it expanded to three locations on the small seaside town’s high street. Grab your cod and mushy peas, and find your spot on the seafront for that most sacred of seaside experiences.

  - id: framlingham
    title: Framlingham
    description: Jump inland along pretty country lanes and alight at the picturesque village of Framlingham. Dominated by a vast castle, the town bustles with visitors exploring the gargantuan walls and quaint tea rooms. This is also where Ed Sheeran is from; so that’s certainly a thing. Walk the castle’s walls and you’ll be rewarded with far-reaching views over the gentle Suffolk countryside.

    title: Southwold Curios
    description: The popular Suffolk seaside retreat of Southwold is one of those well-heeled destinations, a beach town with great restaurants, historic pubs, and picturesque scenes at every corner. Yet on Southwold’s pier lies a place packed with curios and oddities. The Under the Pier Show is a fantastical spot, a reimagining of the penny arcade filled with machines of wit and satire. Try your hand at Wack-a-Banker, or decide the fate of a little lamb in Pet-or-Meat. The mad genius behind the machines is Tim Hunkin, blurring the lines between a modern art installation and old-fashioned seaside fun. A bizarre experience not to be missed!
  - id: theBroads
    title: The Broads
    description: Leave one folk for the other. The Norfolk Broads, a landscape of serene waterways, make for a wonderfully wild escape. The best way to explore them? By boat, naturally. From canoes to river barges with bedrooms and kitchens, head out on the water and breeze past fields of reeds, twisting around the waterways and darting across the vast broads where unique birdlife soundtracks your adventure. Head for small village pubs, or moor your boat in the remotest part you can find.

    title: Blakeney Nature Reserve
    description: Seals, seals and more seals. Take one of the many boat trips running excursions into this popular reserve, where you’ll find one of the highest concentrations of seals anywhere in the country. That’s all there is to it; lots, and lots, and lots of those cute little monsters basking in the sun and taking a dip.
  - id: wellsBeach
    title: Wells Beach
    description: The marvellously long sandy beach at Wells is the perfect spot for a sunbathe and a paddle. Miles and miles of sand stretch to the west, backed by a pine forest and a line of wooden beach huts. They all vary in stature and colour, and if you squint, the sand, treeline and technicolour huts have a certain Caribbean quality to them. If you really squint that is. Pinch yourself; you’re in north Norfolk.
  - id: sandringham
    title: Sandringham
    description: One of the Queen’s estates, Sandringham is a worthy stop off if you’re into seeing how the other half live. There’s no denying the immaculate gardens and gorgeous objets d'art that fill the place, they are all stunning; though, of course, you’ll have to pay to see them.
  - id: kingSLynn
    title: King’s Lynn
    description: Head along the north Norfolk coast for your final destination; the wonderfully historic King’s Lynn. Old merchant houses vie for space on the riverfront, with medieval lanes leading to impressive market squares and thriving local fare. Soak up the historic atmosphere and sink into old world pubs, a final hoorah to the road trip through England’s folks.
