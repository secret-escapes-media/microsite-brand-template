    title: Cheddar Gorge and underground boating
    description: Start at the delightful Cheddar Gorge, near the beginning of the A39. Formed during the last Ice Age, this magnificent canyon is pocked with limestone caves and prehistoric tales, all of which easily whiles away a day of exploring. The village is quaint and pleasant, surrounded by the craggy cliffs; don’t miss the squiggly B3135, which is worth detouring for some rather excellent scenic driving. In Cheddar, best to stock up on the eponymous cheese and crackers for the onward journey. As you leave the Mendips before heading onto the A39, Wookey Hole is a worthwhile stop-off if you haven’t had your cave fix. Here, you can row a small boat in a subterranean lake, something not easily forgotten.

    title: St Audries Bay
    description: It’s a good 70 miles between stops, though the A39 is scenic enough to keep you entertained. If you do need a leg stretch, stop where the Quantock Hills meet the sea. There’s a very pretty and little-known walk between Kilve and Quantoxhead that takes in the best of the coast, where further west you can take a moment at the beautiful beachfront waterfall of St Audries Bay.

    title: Roads
    description: Let’s talk roads. In Exmoor National Park, the A39 becomes rather exciting. Your first taste of this is Porlock Hill. The gradient is severe and surprising, with a slow hairpin reminding you of your climb. The road is walled in by green and brown ferns, covered by trees, until eventually the hill relents and the landscape widens into windswept moorland, with tarmac snaking ahead. After a few miles, it’s time to descend into Lynmouth. Countisbury Hill is even more impressive than the last. As you descend, the road quickly falls away to your right, straight into the sea beneath the cliff face. The views over the sea and the town of Lynmouth are exceptional. It’s quite a spectacular road; more of this later.

    title: Lynmouth
    description: Known as Little Switzerland, Lynmouth is surrounded by hills, taking on an alpine appearance. It’s pretty special; after soaking up the views, browse the clutch of independent shops and eateries, check out the harbour, and consider a ride on the water-powered funicular that scales one of the nearby hills. Stock up on snacks, because the next few local stops are perfect for a picnic.

    title: Valley of Rocks
    description: Take this slight detour from the A39 and head for the crumbling Valley of Rocks. This dry valley, in all its craggy glory, is a scenic outpost on this vertiginous stretch of coastline. Impressive rock formations and hidden caves make this a much-loved stop off for walkers. Time to break out the sandwiches!
  - id: canoeingAtWatersmeet
    title: Canoeing at Watersmeet
    description: Back to that old friend, the A39, trundle along the forested valley (another breathtaking stretch of road) without missing the turning for Watersmeet. It’s not far out of Lynmouth, but a worthy stop; ancient forests meet a wild flowing river, in a scene that you would expect only in the northern reaches of the Highlands. Also, the tea rooms are picture perfect. You can stop here to take it all in, or, take a canoe to the water and explore the woodlands along the river.

    title: Clovelly Village
    description: Clovelly is a strange sort of place. Since Norman times, the whole village has been owned by a single family; it’s changed hands just three times, and even today one family owns the whole thing. And, in a weird archaic twist, they charge entry. Now one would hesitate to suggest the sheer novelty of being charged entry into a village is enough to go ahead and do it; one can also understand the immense feeling of injustice. Park that for now, in fact park at the top of the village - there is no vehicular access possible (you’ll soon find out why). The descent through the cobbled main street is incredibly steep - so much so that deliveries here are performed by sleds (often pulled by donkeys) that you’ll see propped up outside shops and homes. It’s also totally picture perfect, as quaint as can be, with enviable cottages falling down the hillside to the coast.

    title: Boscastle & its witches
    description: After a short drive, head for the coast to the  irresistibly pretty Cornish village of Boscastle. Sat deep in a beautiful river valley, Boscastle is another in what is now a list of desirably picturesque villages. Walk along the steep valley to sea where gorgeous views abound, or, check out the eccentric Museum of Witchcraft & Magic. Or, both!

    title: Rocky Valley
    description: Without the name giving too much away, this valley a little east of Tintagel is a rather beautiful spectacle. As the river cuts its way to the sea, a tall, craggy gorge is cut, with hidden waterfalls and intrepid trails to unpick. Don’t miss the early Bronze Age labyrinth carvings that add a touch of mystery to an already beguiling landscape.

    title: Tintagel
    description: Legends of King Arthur abound at this mysterious and effortlessly romantic spot. Evocative 13th century castle ruins cling to a jutting headland, overlooking wild seas below. Head for the secluded beach at the cliff foot via a narrow staircase, a setting made all the more impressive by the looming castle and caves. Discover the myths and legends of this remarkable place, one of the most dramatic ruins in the country.
  - id: portIsaac
    title: Port Isaac
    description: Your final stop on the north coast of Cornwall, Port Isaac is another irresistibly-pretty fishing village. The hit TV series Doc Martin was filmed here, and it’s not hard to see why - it’s a beautiful, typically Cornish place. Local, sought-after  chef Nathan Outlaw has also set up shop here, making this somewhat of a foodie hotspot. A perfect time to sink into a restaurant and indulge the last throes of your Atlantic Highway road trip.
