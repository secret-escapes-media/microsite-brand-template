  - id: whitby
    title: Whitby
    description: Spiritual home of the goths, Whitby is a Yorkshire gem that perfectly juxtaposes a passion for melodrama with quaint seaside kitsch. Maybe it’s the looming remains of the famed abbey that overlooks the town, its gothic ruin thread with whispers of vampires and spooky happenings. Well it is that, that and the sweet shops and trinket stops that line the pilgrimage up the cliff that it perches on. It’s a curious mish mash, but one that is self-aware and undoubtedly woven into a setting that is very, very pretty. Oh, and the fish and chips here are excellent, of course. Your trip is ahead of you, but Whitby is not to be rushed; it is a scarily pleasant place.

    title: Robin Hood’s Bay
    description: Yorkshire’s coastline has its fair share of traditional seaside towns, with their arcades, promenades and bucket-and-spade traditionalism. Robin Hood’s Bay is not one of them. This petite fishing village retains an untouched beauty, one of narrow, cobbled streets lined with ship captains’ ivy-clad cottages, throwback tearooms and artist studios. And no surprise artists flock here; the view of the bay is a rare glimpse into a time gone past, where life was governed by the churning North Sea. It’s a good final hoorah to this pretty coastline, before you veer inland to continue your Yorkshire drive.
  - id: goathland
    title: Goathland
    description: The North York Moors unfold at every turn. It’s an idyllic type of scenery, studded with familiar stone-cut villages immortalised in countless soaps and films. Hence this first stop, Goathland. Goathland’s honey-hued cottages and village-green pleasantry served as a backdrop for soap Heartbeat, though its more international claim to fame centres around the steam railway station, the site of Hogsmeade station in the Harry Potter films. After a quick photo op, onwards, leaving the moors behind.

    title: Pickering & Thornton-le-Dale
    description: Leave via Pickering, whose Norman castle ruin is the gateway to the moors. This bustling market town is filled with mom & pop shops, from bakeries to butchers, and indoor markets packed with local produce and antiques. Mondays are the busiest days, when the weekly market rolls into town. Just east of the town lies Thornton-le-Dale, another one of those chocolate-box villages that typify the rural beauty of this corner of Yorkshire. Pretty waterways dissect the small village, so take a stroll past the gorgeous thatched cottages and flowing streams for a rather twee adventure through this photogenic stop-off.

    title: Aysgarth Falls
    description: Leave Pickering heading east. At the pretty town of Helmsley, go north to explore the roads that traverse the moors. At Laskill, take the single track road to Hawnby, heading north again toward Northallerton. Phew! It’s definitely the scenic way, but that’s what this whole trip is about. The views over the moors, the twists the turns… Well, now it’s on to the Dales. Start at the area’s showstopper - the Aysgarth Falls. A series of shallow, step-like falls stretch along a mile of the River Ure. Follow the path along the river to take in the Lower, Middle and Upper falls, which make up a truly captivating scene in the Dales.

    title: Buttertubs Pass
    description: It may be the long way round to Hawes, but this road is worth the detour. Indulge your motoring passions with a spin round the Buttertubs Pass. This dramatic road clings to the edge of the valley, with a rather flimsy rail warning of the rather fierce drop to one side. When you reach the summit, stop and eye the pass’s namesake - the strange craggy potholes known as the Buttertubs. A waterfall sinks into one of the holes, and the views up here are pretty special.

    title: Hawes
    description: After the hair-raising ride along the Buttertubs Pass, sink into the slow life with a stop at the pretty market town of Hawes. This is the heart of Wensleydale, a name which should be familiar; tuck in to the town’s foodie spots (market day is Tuesday) and don’t miss picking up - you guessed it - Wensleydale cheese! Hawes even has its own waterfall in the centre of town, a picturesque backdrop to the antique and craft shops you can explore.
  - id: grassington
    title: Grassington
    description: Heading south through the Dales, you’ll reach another picture-postcard perfect village. Grassington’s Georgian centre, with its cobbled squares and picturesque cottages, is a wonderful base for exploring the local Dales, or sinking into a cosy pub for a spot of lunch. It’s quaint backdrop plays host to a number of annual festivals, from arts events to nostalgic recreations that have recently featured on the telly box.
  - id: harrogate
    title: Harrogate
    description: As you leave the rolling hills of the Dales, finish your Yorkshire road trip in the bustling town of Harrogate. The quintessential Victorian spa resort, Harrogate remains an upmarket, bougie getaway - its manicured gardens and Regency architecture are a fitting backdrop to cream tea elevenses and afternoon spa treatments, with all the pomp and indulgence that you would typically deserve after days of travelling around Yorkshire. So sink into it - you deserve it.
